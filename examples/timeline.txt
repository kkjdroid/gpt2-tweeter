You asked: How do we test Olli's comfort? Comfort while navigating over bumpy roads is very important! To test Olli, we turn on "manual mode" and carefully navigate over various sizes of speed bumps, tracking movement from the inside and comfort of our test riders. #MeetOlli https://t.co/Extqg7rvmh

They told us: you should have someone install speed bumps so you can test Olli on them. 

We said: Nah, we'll just 3D-print some &amp; install them ourselves. 

So we did, &amp; here they are! Freshly printed &amp; installed speed bumps for all the Olli "smooth ride" testing we can imagine. https://t.co/Lm51IkckIr

Yesterday, we joined the #SocialGoodTech Twitter chat hosted by @plus_socialgood. We discussed how 3D-printing has the potential to transform the physical world. If you missed the live chat, you can find our recap of the questions and answers on the blog: https://t.co/eYoQW0VCT4

Last week was nothing short of amazing as our microfactory was filled with inquisitive minds of students participating in the 2018 Destination Imagination competition. Read more on our blog: https://t.co/rxpAFAOsLh

Today, on National #AutonomousVehicleDay, we celebrate Olli &amp; all others who are shaping the future of transportation. Olli's sensors work quickly to identify all potential obstacles, &amp; respond faster than a human could, ensuring safety for those on board &amp; around the vehicle. https://t.co/1GST17XqCn

A8: We may be a bit bias, but... vehicles. There's a great opportunity for more people to leverage #3dprinting for mass customization, reduced part counts, sustainability, technology integration, etc.  #SocialGoodTech https://t.co/GvBHdSPjQ0

A7: Raw materials are used for the process &amp; products will be made (mostly) on-demand, which reduce the need for large warehouses &amp; reduces waste due to obsolescence. Currently, additive structures are fairly homogeneous, which makes recycling very simple. #SocialGoodTech https://t.co/1NCi4ndL3M

A6: As of 2015, they are encouraging more companies to invest in #3dprinting technology. This will definitely benefit humanitarian aid and medical supply accessibility. #SocialGoodTech https://t.co/PMld4WrGYh

A5: Our favorite printing solutions? The additive ones...  #SocialGoodTech https://t.co/SJp7vma0UP

A4: Though the machines seem pricey, the tech is already affordable &amp; accessible. $/vol for desktop machines is ~$0.20/in^3. On the lrg scale, it's only ~$0.65/ in^3, they are dealing with larger volumes (millions of cubic inches on the lrg scale vs. thousands on the sml scale) https://t.co/7LkHM94DCh

A3:   Barriers to implementing #3dprinting for us were: 1.) Consistency across machines, variable environmental conditions, and material certification,  2.) Non-destructive part validation, and 3.) Process and mechanical simulation. https://t.co/wTTrkGqVLI

A2: Additive manufacturing is used to create: prototypes, as-printed structural parts, &amp; low-cost tooling/molds. In the healthcare sector, it's being used to print tumors for cancer therapy research. This is happening on both large &amp; small scales with all kinds of materials. https://t.co/0ipKAzeJYx

"Olli is not trying to fit the current standards of the industry, but rather remake the car manufacturing business." https://t.co/KWWqXBk3Z6
