To be clear  we flagged the ad, *not* the story  which is all over Facebook with many likes and shares. Why? All advertisers running ads that show political content must first verify their identity. For more details, see @robjective's (VP Ads for Facebook) reply below https://t.co/PWDhcazBzY

Thanks @SenCortezMasto The NYT is wrong on this point. Companies like Blackberry and MSFT couldnt integrate peoples FB information with their devices without that persons permission. https://t.co/9944NvNtRn

Hi @davidcicilline. This is an important point. But the NYT is wrong about user controls. These companies could not integrate peoples Facebook information with their devices without that persons permission. https://t.co/XcOgw73BhW

Hi @SenBlumenthal, You raise an important issue but NYT is wrong on this point. Blackberry, Amazon, Microsoft etc could not integrate peoples FB information with their devices without that persons permission. https://t.co/IXVTAScpww

If you see an ad which you believe has political content and isnt labeled, please report it. Tap the three dots at the top right-hand corner of the ad, select report, and then it refers to a political candidate or issue. https://t.co/XXZq6Xw2G3

This is what a label looks like. It includes a Paid for by disclosure from the advertiser at the top. Clicking on the label will take you to an archive with more information, which can also be reached by anyone in the world at https://t.co/dVRHaRgTLC https://t.co/8PNKX05axJ

Starting today, all election-related and issue ads in the US must be clearly labeled. Advertisers running these kinds of ads will need to verify their identity and location. People deserve to have more information on who's behind these types of ads. https://t.co/HXODDClRpP https://t.co/Fd1k4EQL37
