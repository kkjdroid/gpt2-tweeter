Nevada doesn't use nuclear energy, we don't produce nuclear waste, and we shouldn't be forced to store it.

Great news that @USVETSLV and the @SalArmySONV in Las Vegas will be receiving over $1.1 million to help provide services to vets who have experienced homelessness. No one who has served our country should have to worry about where they will sleep at night. https://t.co/pyVWfop4zb

DREAMers are essential members of our Las Vegas community. @senatemajldr, stop the stonewalling and show some courage. It's time to pass the #DreamAndPromiseAct now!

I am saddened to hear about the vandalism at @thecenterlv this morning. This is a reminder that we must stand united against bigotry and speak out against hate in all its ugly forms.

Today I stood with @RepSusieLee and @RepHorsford to demand better working conditions, pay, and benefits for working families. Its time for the Senate to join the House in passing the #RaiseTheWage Act to make sure that no one has to work two jobs just to put food on the table. https://t.co/glZZOoNCxk

Mother Jones said to pray for the dead and fight like hell for the living. You can count on me to do that. Happy Labor Day. #UnionStrong

We can do something about gun violence  and to make sure that more cities dont feel the pain that Las Vegas did, we absolutely must.

The President left his chair empty at the @G7 climate change meeting while the Amazon is on fire. His denial of settled science is dangerous.

Wishing a great first day of school to @unlv students, teachers, administrators, and everyone else who is working hard to make this school year a success! #UNLVWelcome https://t.co/te76CSIZI4

Today we recognize and celebrate #WomensEqualityDay. While the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote, many women of color remained disenfranchised until the 1960s. We have made real progress, but the fight for full equality is far from over.

Donald Trump is using his press conference at the @G7 to advertise his resort in South Florida. He knows that he would profit by hosting the G7 there next year. This President makes corruption look casual.

President Trump's attempt to eliminate the Flores settlement - an agreement that protects migrant children in detention - is illegal and unconscionable. We shouldn't have to rely on the courts to overturn Trump's cruelty.

This Trump Administration proposal gives a license to discriminate against those who too often already struggle to access quality, affordable health care. It's a shameful attack against the LGBT community and I will continue to fight it. https://t.co/MskgDBQR2I

DREAMers and TPS recipients are essential members of the Las Vegas community. Thats why I helped pass the #DreamAndPromise Act in the House and its time for the Senate to do the same. The symbol of the United States must always remain the Statue of Liberty. #DreamandPromiseNow https://t.co/64RCoEY1ml

Social Security serves families - including over 536,000 seniors, children, and adults with disabilities in Nevada - who are relying on Congress to protect it, expand it, and defend it from Republican attacks. #SocSec84 https://t.co/gQnnSfkKpW

Trump and Nixon have a lot in common, but at least Nixon listened to scientists and conservationists when he signed the #EndangeredSpeciesAct into law. We must speak out against the Trump Administration's disregard for our environment.
https://t.co/1umY8Ze8Bg

The epidemic of gun violence is a public health crisis. It's time for @senatemajldr McConnell to take up and pass #HR8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act. We already passed it in the House and now it's up to the Senate to #DoSomething to protect our communities.

The Trump Administration just put forward another cruel plan to cut legal immigration and put food, health care, and housing further out of reach for immigrant families. Thats why I co-sponsored a bill to block this disgraceful proposal from going into effect. #ProtectFamilies https://t.co/nZ8wv3NFBz

The senseless mass shootings in Gilroy, El Paso, and Dayton provide three more tragic examples of why firearms with high-capacity magazines have no place in our communities. We dont want to see any more examples.

If President Trump were serious about addressing the epidemic of gun violence, he would ask @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell to advance the bills @HouseDemocrats already passed in the House to expand background checks.

Today I attended the nationwide kickoff of the @ProtectOurCare bus tour to bring awareness to Republicans' continued attacks on our healthcare system. That's why I voted to let the House step in to protect the Affordable Care Act and the millions who depend on it. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/tCpwEbIOl4

My heart breaks for Gilroy. As we thank the first responders on the scene who likely prevented further injuries and loss of life, we must remember that we aren't powerless in the face of the gun violence epidemic. This is a public health crisis and we must treat it as such.

Buffalo Soldiers were the first regiment of all-black peacetime soldiers in the U.S. Army. Today we celebrate #BuffaloSoldiersDay in Nevada to honor the courageous military men for their service and sacrifice.

No President in modern history has so explicitly shown that he doesnt care to represent all of the country. His racist attacks on @RepCummings and Baltimore are just the latest example.

Today Robert Mueller suggested that Donald Trump, while under oath, did not tell the truth to law enforcement. He plainly stated that President Trump could be indicted once he leaves office. There is now more evidence that the President committed serious crimes.

Nearly half of all cellphone calls in 2019 will be scams. #Robocalls are more than a nuisance - they are dangerous. That's why I cosponsored the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act which passed the House today. It's time to put an end to illegal and unwanted calls.

Russia interfered in our election in an effort to help Donald Trump. Donald Trump's campaign welcomed that help - and several of his top aides have pleaded guilty to lying about it.

The President attempted to interfere with the criminal investigation into an attack on our democracy. Yet Republicans on this committee are trying to call Robert Mueller un-American???

We are over an hour into the hearing about Robert Mueller's report which found that "the Russian government interfered in our election in sweeping and systematic fashion." No Republican on the committee has asked about that attack on our democracy.

Today I introduced the GLOBE Act to restore the @StateDept role in protecting LGBTI rights worldwide. Under the Trump Administration, the U.S. is failing to defend the rights of LGBTI people abroad. No person should face discrimination because of who they are or whom they love.

The @USGLC Nevada Advisory Committee encourages investments in international development and diplomacy to advance our interests at home and abroad. That's one of my key priorities on @HouseForeign, and it was a pleasure to attend todays meeting. https://t.co/OKRD4MEY8b

#OTD in 1848, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott held the first conference on womens rights in Seneca Falls. The significant strides we have made since then are worth celebrating, but there is still plenty of work to be done. https://t.co/3no3mAImbM

Workers in Las Vegas and across the country deserve a raise - and @HouseDemocrats just voted to give them one. Too many workers struggle to pay rent and put food on the table. It's disgraceful that Trump and @SenateGOP are blocking this bill while giving tax cuts to the rich.

On this day in 1962, the last atmospheric nuclear test in the U.S. occurred at the Nevada Test Site. We must ensure that every individual who was exposed to radiation from atomic weapons testing throughout our state receives the full support of the federal government.

Millions of patients across the country would lose their health insurance if Donald Trump's lawsuit to eliminate the Affordable Care Act is successful - including 282,000 Nevadans. @HouseDemocrats are fighting the Trump Administration in court to #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/CUQyqUZh0G

I teamed up with @RepBrianMast to write this @USATODAY piece because few members of the public are aware that the federal government uses taxpayer money to hurt puppies in painful and unnecessary lab experiments. We have a plan to change that.

Donald Trump's bigoted attacks over the weekend were intended to divide this country. That's why it's important for leaders on both sides of the aisle to speak up. It shouldn't be so hard to denounce xenophobia and racism.

The level of incompetence at @ENERGY is only matched by its dishonesty. For decades, the DOE has been an untrustworthy partner and this latest round of illegal shipments is truly a new low.

I refuse to let the Trump Administration sabotage the U.S. health care system and take away protections for people with pre-existing conditions. That's why I voted to let the House step in to protect the Affordable Care Act and the millions who depend on it. #ProtectOurCare

.@SecretaryAcosta failed miserably to deliver justice for the underage girls that Jeffrey Epstein abused and exploited. The @USDOL should never have been overseen by someone who allowed a serial sexual predator to live a life of luxury. Secretary Acosta must resign immediately.

Donald Trump is trying to use @TheJusticeDept as a tool to eliminate health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions. It's the latest attempt by this Administration to restrict access to health care - and it is dangerous.

Colonel John Nixon gave the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia today in 1776. Each day we must work to make this nation a more perfect union.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law the National Labor Relations Act on this day in 1935, granting employees the right to form and join unions. We must continue to fight to allow collective bargaining for improved working conditions, pay, and benefits.

The earthquake yesterday - felt across our state - is yet another reminder of how dangerous it would be to make Nevada the dumping ground for the nations nuclear waste. Ill continue to lead the fight to block Yucca Mountain.

Today we celebrate the 55th Anniversary of the signing of the #CivilRightsAct into law. This landmark legislation provided protections against segregation in public places and outlawed discriminatory employment practices. We must continue the fight for justice for all.

My heart still aches for the victims of the 1 October shooting. In Las Vegas, thoughts and prayers are not enough and neither are flimsy executive actions that get tied up in the courts. Im proud to join @RepCicilline in introducing commonsense legislation to ban bump stocks.

Each day the United States Postal Service delivers 187.8 million pieces of mail across the country. On #NationalPostalWorkerDay we thank the hard working men and women who are responsible for delivering mail to our homes and offices.

I voted against the recent border funding bill because it's wrong to give this Administration billions of taxpayer dollars with virtually no strings attached. I don't trust Trump or his anti-immigration extremists to spend this money in a way that will help the children in need.

Happy #CanadaDay to our friends in the north! The United States and Canada maintain a special bond and an economic partnership that benefits people of both nations. https://t.co/myKeKIU2E3

Two years ago today the first recreational marijuana sales began in Nevada. With the help of @GovSisolak, we are going to set an example for the rest of the nation to follow.

DREAMers and TPS holders are teachers, nurses, and entrepreneurs. More importantly, they are our neighbors, friends, and colleagues. They are asking for nothing more than a shot at the American Dream. #DreamandPromiseNow https://t.co/BtJVnzZajk

The House just passed the American Dream and Promise Act! I spoke on the floor today about the over 15,000 Dreamers and TPS holders in the heart of Las Vegas. The symbol of the United States must always remain the Statue of Liberty. #DreamandPromiseNow https://t.co/WwFFD0wMYY

I stopped listening to the details of Trumps new immigration plan after I heard it didnt include a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers. The symbol of the United States should remain the Statue of Liberty, not an ineffective border wall.

Trump is profiting from his presidency in violation of the Constitution. Instead of separating himself from the Trump Organizations business interests, the President is essentially accepting bribes from giant corporations and foreign governments looking for sweetheart deals. https://t.co/wsZREG0ERj

I'm horrified by this racist video. I taught at UNLV for over 30 years and I know these disgusting, hateful comments don't reflect the values of UNLV's student body.

Habitat destruction, exploitation, and climate change are driving the loss of half of the worlds wild animal population. On #EarthDay, lets recommit to protecting endangered species and safeguarding our only home. https://t.co/sDrn7NuWxI

Im heartbroken by the horrifying terrorist attack in Sri Lanka on Easter morning. We must all stand with the Sri Lankan people in confronting this evil.

#ChagSameach to all who are celebrating Passover. During this holiday, may we be mindful of those fleeing persecution and violence around the world.

The redacted version of the Mueller report details the sweeping Russian effort to help Donald Trump win the presidency and the repeated attempts of Donald Trump and his allies to minimize Vladimir Putins attack on our democracy. 1/4

Many Americans have lost their faith in the independence of the Department of Justice after the Attorney General put on that shameful political display designed to protect the President. I'm one of them.

Today @USVETSLV is hosting the Veterans Stand Down event to provide a range of services for veterans in our community. Resources will include employment assistance and housing placement. Come stop by our table  well be here until 5 pm! #TeamTitus #LVSD19 https://t.co/a70JYHURXw

From closing the background check loophole to addressing climate change and building a majority female staff, I'm proud of all @GovSisolak has accomplished in just his first 100 days on the job. https://t.co/sCOIIpmAhU

Yesterday #TeamTitus joined @NFTC_NP at their 3rd Annual Tax-A-Thon. The Coalition worked hard to provide free assistance from IRS-certified volunteers, and we are tremendously grateful for their service to the community. https://t.co/uK4DiXVH4m

My heart goes out to my friends in France after seeing the tragic images of the Notre-Dame Cathedral on fire. Let's take a moment to thank the first responders who are protecting people and doing whatever possible to preserve this iconic symbol of faith, art, and history.

I'm excited to share that my bill to recognize the contributions of school employees has become law! School nurses, janitors, counselors, cafeteria workers, security guards, and bus drivers work tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure the success of our students and schools. 1/3

I'm pleased to announce that Las Vegas will receive a $5 million grant under the @DHSgov Urban Area Security Initiative. This grant is an important investment in the safety and security of Las Vegas residents and the nearly 43 million visitors who travel here each year.

Donald Trump's discriminatory and cruel #TransMilitaryBan goes into effect today, but the fight to protect these patriots is far from over. Transgender people who have volunteered to serve in our military make this nation safer. We see you, we hear you, and we stand with you.

With the dangerous rise of anti-Semitism, we must recommit ourselves to fighting injustice. Thank you @UNLVLaw for hosting todays Anti-Semitism in America discussion to encourage our community to combat hate and bigotry. #TeamTitus https://t.co/rNQIdnTh1s

Today is #OpeningDay at @TheLVBallpark! Wishing the @AviatorsLV best of luck on their first game at their new home! #GoAviators

I'm proud to work with @RepSpeier to introduce this bill. Seniors should have full confidence that their doctors are making medical decisions based on each patients health care needs, not the physicians financial interests. https://t.co/Q3f1kxrQYN

Nevada doesn't use nuclear energy, we don't produce nuclear waste, and we shouldn't be forced to store it. I testified today to inform the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee of the full cost of Yucca Mountain. We shouldn't waste another penny on this unsafe project. https://t.co/UsH7cSyys8

The @US_EDA helps ensure Americas success in the global economy. This year, Congress gave the EDA the resources it needs to fulfill its mission, but shamefully the #TrumpBudget proposes to eliminate the agency. We can't let that happen. @TransportDems https://t.co/X0vUdRbiC7

A free and open internet promotes innovation, access to information, and economic competition. That's why I'm working to pass the #SaveTheNet Act and fighting to restore #NetNeutrality

On #FormerPOWRecognitionDay we recognize the courage and strength of our military service members who endured brutal treatment at the hands of their captors. We are thankful for their sacrifice and commitment to protecting our freedom. #POWMIA

The Trump Administration is trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act through the courts without even offering a replacement. We can't let them take us back to the days when health insurance companies could discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions.

Kirjsten Nielsen served as @DHSgov Secretary for over a year. She apparently failed to meet with even a single DREAMer. She denied the existence of the family separation policy that she helped orchestrate. She carried out Trump's anti-immigrant agenda. She will not be missed.

Donald Trump claims that us @HouseDemocrats havent visited the border recently. When he talks about immigration, he seems incable of telling the truth. https://t.co/wjEUGPWp1A

As professor emeritus of @UNLV, I am proud of its distinction as the most ethnically diverse institution in the nation. Today I attended the annual Festival of Communities to celebrate the rich cultural traditions of Las Vegas with student groups on campus. #OnlyInDistrict1 https://t.co/RwphxNtpNG

It was great to be with friends at the 4th Annual Spring Festival hosted by the Kizuna Japanese Society. Today featured an array of unique cuisines, crafts, and entertainment in celebration of Japanese culture. #OnlyInDistrict1 https://t.co/Hr4pskHM6k

The last time Donald Trump came to our state, he promised to oppose the unsafe, unsound storage of nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain.

More than 13,000 #DACA recipients work, go to college, serve in our military, and call Nevada home. Congress must #ProtectTheDream by passing the #DreamandPromiseAct. But until then, I encourage all #DACA recipients to renew their status today. https://t.co/DYmao0G0xi

Come visit us in Las Vegas!  https://t.co/OaoUB98BJB

#VAWA saves lives. Today I joined my House colleagues in voting to pass #VAWA19, which will improve services for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Now it's time for the Senate to do its job and send this bill to the President's desk. https://t.co/4cUubzePhG

No country should criminalize people for living their truth and loving who they love. I stand with the international community in condemning Bruneis brutal and barbaric anti-LGBTI stoning law.

The @UNLV College of Fine Arts Hall of Fame recognizes those who have made a significant impact on the arts in Las Vegas and around the world. Congratulations to tonights inductees! #OnlyInDistrict1 #TeamTitus https://t.co/zkq1dUMNg7

It was a pleasure meeting with @NVNationalGuard today and to thank these patriots for their service to our state and our country. https://t.co/n4f5K3ftGR

In Nevada, women make 83 cents for every dollar men make. I helped pass the #PaycheckFairness Act in the House to put us one step closer to ensuring that every woman can take home the pay she rightfully earns. Now it's time for the Senate to do the same. #EqualPayDay

.@GrantAGift was formed in 2009 to deliver hope and resources for all touched by autism. In observance of #WorldAutismAwarenessDay and #AutismAwarenessMonth, #TeamTitus joined the Foundation today to discuss how we can continue autism support in our community. https://t.co/ycmNMoP6EA

I'm proud to have worked with my colleagues to put an end to the @USDA's wasteful and cruel taxpayer-funded kitten testing. This is a major victory for kittens, cats, and taxpayers. https://t.co/GW3up2NxsV

Today I sent letters to the Appropriations Committee with @RepSusieLee and @RepHorsford, urging the committee to block Yucca Mountain and prevent more plutonium shipments. We can't let @ENERGY treat Nevada as a dumping ground for the nations toxic material and nuclear waste.

This morning I submitted a letter in support of #AB291, which is sponsored by #1October survivor @sandra4nv. This bill would ban bump stocks and tighten regulations for people who shouldn't have firearms. Thanks @MomsDemand for your support. #nvleg https://t.co/h7v3h4Cbg2

Today marks the start of #JazzAppreciationMonth. There are so many opportunities to celebrate in Las Vegas, especially by visiting Myrons Cabaret Jazz at The @SmithCenterLV. #OnlyInDistrict1 https://t.co/SNPkmtsZk3

Thank you @GovSisolak for helping ensure that all Nevadans will be counted in the upcoming census. This is a matter of grave importance to our state. An accurate count is essential to support our schools, hospitals, and roads. #NevadaCounts https://t.co/w7eYSElUoI

The only viable long-term solution to nuclear storage is a consent-based process. We cannot allow Nevada to become the nation's dumping ground for nuclear waste.

The @NVWomensLobby is dedicated to promoting equity for women and protecting their reproductive freedom. During Grassroots Lobby Days, lets thank the activists who raise their voices on behalf of Nevadas women and children! #NVLeg

The public has a right to know exactly what Robert Mueller and his team concluded. A short summary from the Attorney General simply isn't good enough. #ReleaseTheReport

Tonight #TeamTitus attended the 3rd Annual Nation of Immigrants Seder at @TempleSinaiLV. Thank you to @ADL_Nevada for bringing diverse communities together to build bridges of understanding. https://t.co/4dbpgsv7ye

Slashing funding for the Special Olympics is really just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the cruelty of the #TrumpBudget. The Presidents proposal includes a number of other items that would be disastrous for Nevada and for the nation:

I just returned from the floor of the House where I voted to #protecttranstroops from Trumps discriminatory military ban. Come by my D.C. office and youll see us proudly displaying this flag for #transdayofvisibility https://t.co/jDN70TH60A

Great news for Nevada and the nation! Legislation just passed a key House committee to free up the banking system to work with cannabis businesses that are operating legally. I'll fight for this bill to become law.

The House just passed legislation to strengthen protections against gender-based wage discrimination. It's 2019. There should be nothing controversial about fighting for #EqualPayForEqualWork

Thanks for stopping by @ASPCA! I'm proud to be your partner. We must continue to make animal welfare a priority in Congress. https://t.co/3gCPCG5gTv

It was a pleasure to speak with TRIO students from @UNLVTheCenter, @NevadaState, and @unevadareno about their higher education aspirations. Its inspiring to spend time with motivated future leaders who cant wait to get started with their college education. https://t.co/v8DJFfmhKt

Im excited to announce that @SNHDinfo will receive a @HHS grant for over $1 million to help Southern Nevadans with family planning services. At a time when federal funding for family planning is under attack by the President, Ill keep fighting for women's access to health care.

#TeamTitus joined @UNLVLaw to examine the Supreme Courts decision on Korematsu v. US, which upheld the internment of Japanese-Americans during WWII. This horrific chapter in our nations history reminds us that we must continue to fight against xenophobia in all its ugly forms. https://t.co/E90GoG2N5r

Regardless of what the Supreme Court decides to do about bump stocks, we cant afford for the safety of our communities to be tied up in never-ending legal disputes. Congress must take action. I'll continue to lead the effort in the House to ban bump stocks once and for all.

Thank you @LeaderHoyer, Chairman @RepEliotEngel, and @RepSusieLee for stopping by my annual luncheon with Nevadas @AIPAC delegation for an honest discussion about how we can continue to strengthen the relationship between the U.S. and Israel. https://t.co/ZL2ZGd3LXs

Donald Trump promised Mexico would pay for the wall and instead he stole from our troops to pay for some of it. While I'm disappointed that many of my Republican colleagues have thrown the Constitution aside, I'm confident that our courts will not.

Last night #TeamTitus attended the @BlackMtnInst biannual Jim Rogers Contrarian Lecture Series with an original essay by @AmandaFortini on The People of Las Vegas. Thanks for highlighting the depth and diversity of our local community! https://t.co/33ZdZ72wSS

Donald Trump is trying - yet again - to take us back to the days when insurance companies could discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions. Families shouldn't go bankrupt trying to pay their medical bills. @HouseDemocrats will fight this in court. https://t.co/U8CYf59USV

Happy Greek Independence Day! Today we celebrate the special bond between our two democracies as we recognize and cherish the boundless spirit of the Hellenic community.

I joined my fellow @HouseDemocrats to introduce legislation to #ProtectTheDream because immigrants are an essential part of the Las Vegas community. In my district alone, this bill would protect over 15,000 DREAMers and TPS recipients from Trump's anti-immigrant agenda.

#TeamTitus will be at the @LouRuvoCenter for their Spring into Health Fare until 2pm today. Stop by for free eye exams and blood pressure tests. https://t.co/bkwVQI1pwQ

Ill be speaking to the Nevada Legislature shortly about some of the challenges facing our state and how we can work together to address them. You can watch live here: https://t.co/Gt4NIrzijx

This is horrific. Congress must prevent government agencies from wasting taxpayer dollars to conduct cruel experiments on animals. I'll continue to lead this fight and support legislation to put an end to this kind of grotesque abuse. https://t.co/Eo8Pnyo2Sq

When @BLMNational announced a new wild horse purchase policy that opened the door to kill buyers, I joined @VernBuchanan in calling on @Interior to reverse this cruel and misguided decision. Today Im happy to report that our voices were heard and this policy is no more.

The @LLN_USA highlights the success of Latino leaders and empowers them to build relationships and share their stories. Today #TeamTitus congratulates former Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval on receiving the Eagle Leadership Award. https://t.co/XF2ntoIULj

The House and Senate have both taken action to stop the #FakeEmergency declaration. Trumps veto shows how little he cares about the Constitution.

People of faith should not have to fear for their safety when they practice their religion. I stand in solidarity with the people of New Zealand and our Muslim sisters and brothers around the world in the face of this cowardly terrorism. We must always speak out against hate.

The House just unanimously passed a resolution calling for the public release of Robert Muller's final report. 

Donald Trump has called for "total transparency" in this investigation. 

I'm sure he won't regret it.

I taught a lot of students at UNLV who were the first in their families to go to college. I had students who worked two jobs to pay for their own tuition. For parents to just write a check and rig the college admissions process is unconscionable. https://t.co/mNtbtFSeWE

Great meeting with @advcyclingassoc to discuss bike traveling and tourism. #AdventureCycling  https://t.co/GZxE0GUbQW

No employee should be at risk of being fired simply because of who they love. Sadly, this is a reality for #LGBTQ Americans in many states. We must put an end to end this discrimination by passing the #EqualityAct.

This discrimination is preventing our military from recruiting and retaining the best troops who are willing to serve our nation. The Trump Administration's political agenda is bigoted and harmful. #ProtectTransTroops https://t.co/G5pjORJkhO

Glad to have some of our local postal supervisors in for a visit. They certainly have my stamp of approval! https://t.co/la7dTtdNbY

Every dollar this Administration proposes to put towards the revitalization of Yucca Mountain is another dollar down a rat hole because this unsafe, unsound project should never see the light of day. https://t.co/t7WNcVzZWK

By proposing that even more money be wasted on Yucca Mountain, Trump has broken the promise he made to Nevadans during his recent visit to Elko. Every dollar this Administration tries to put towards the revitalization of Yucca Mountain is another dollar down a rat hole... (1/2) https://t.co/KayS80nb7X

The @LGBTEqCaucus is now at its largest size ever in the history of the U.S. House of Representatives. We must use this historic opportunity to make real progress in the fight for LGBT equality.

.@HouseDemocrats just voted to put an end to the #CultureOfCorruption in Trump's Washington. #HR1 protects our elections against foreign interference, dismantles discriminatory barriers to voting, and requires all Presidential candidates to release their tax returns.

In the words of Shirley Chisholm, If they dont give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair. On #InternationalWomensDay, and every day, lets continue to ensure that women have a seat at the table. #BalanceForBetter #IWD2019 https://t.co/iNIrgqJLgi

Today #TeamTitus joined @UNLV and @BrookingsInst Mountain West to witness The Great Debate, where participants battled it out over the topic of single-payer national health insurance in the U.S. Great job @RichardvReeves, @JohnJHudak, and nationally ranked @UNLVDebate! https://t.co/m7Y2kTXmGn

Every woman has the right to live free from abuse and domestic violence. Today, I'm working with my fellow @HouseDemocrats to reauthorize #VAWA and introduce new steps to support survivors.

We have a responsibility to investigate the extent of Donald Trumps effort to abuse his office for personal financial gain. I joined @Maddow last night to share the latest updates. We will demand honest answers from this Administration. https://t.co/HCB0umyVe1

Ill be joining @maddow tonight to discuss the latest in our oversight of Donald Trumps involvement in blocking the relocation of the FBI headquarters. Tune into @MSNBC just after 9:30 PM EST!

Fighting for a free and open internet is about giving power back to the people. I'm proud to support legislation that will restore #NetNeutrality and promote innovation, access to information, and a competitive economy. #SaveTheNet

A year ago, @SecNielsen testified to Congress that she had never met a DREAMer. 

So today I gave her the opportunity to tell a story about meeting one of these inspiring young people. 

She...didn't have one. https://t.co/MNn1b6I62N

For far too long, the Trump Administration has pursued an anti-immigrant agenda with no Congressional oversight. That changes today. As a member of @HomelandDems, I'll be questioning @SecNielsen at our hearing this morning.

Congratulations to @Nicole4Nevada on serving as the next Nevada Senate Majority Leader! I know you will fight for hardworking Nevadans and help move our state forward.

Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are the fastest growing minority in Nevada. Yet, the typical AAPI woman loses at least $292,400 over her career to the wage gap. We need #AAPIEqualPay now. @NWLC

Today I introduced a bill to stop any attempt to revive Yucca Mountain. The Trump Administrations attempt to treat our state as the dumping ground for the nations nuclear waste is based on dirty politics, not sound science. https://t.co/wZiCKwAW2V

Tonight we joined the @NeonMuseum to celebrate the lighting of the famous @HardRockHotelLV guitar! #OnlyinDistrict1 https://t.co/NCqw4Ko06V

Last week the House passed a bill I wrote to honor the nation's best school support professionals. Today I met Virginia Mills, about whom I spoke on the House floor.

From the suffragettes to the Women's March to the halls of Congress, women will continue to stand together and fight together. During #WomensHistoryMonth, let's honor the brave women upon whose shoulders we stand.

While this temporary relief is good news, plenty more #TPS recipients and their families are still facing uncertainty and the threat of separation. We must fight back against Donald Trump's anti-immigrant agenda with the Dream and Promise Act. https://t.co/p3VWo6dYaY

#TeamTitus celebrates the opening of Roseman Medical Group, a clinic of @RosemanMedicines new physician facility with @LasVegasHEALS. https://t.co/DxHnYV192v

Any funding put towards the Yucca Mountain licensing process is a waste of time and resources. Thats why I sent a letter to President Trump with @RepSusieLee and @RepHorsford, insisting that the Administration include no additional Yucca Mountain funding in its upcoming budget.

#TeamTitus joined local film director Stan Armstrong &amp; @RanchoRamsLV for a screening of "The Rancho High School Riots" to teach students about efforts to desegregate CCSD in the 1970's. We must continue to work peacefully to improve equity in our education system. https://t.co/nvdj90HKUO

Michael Cohen's testimony is proof that @HouseDemocrats oversight is not only justified, but vital to our democracy. It's embarrassing for Republicans to continue to ignore evidence of criminality by a sitting President.

Background checks save lives. By passing #HR8, my House colleagues and I are helping keep our communities safe. Taking action to reduce gun violence is long overdue and were just getting started.

The #MedicareforAll Act will help guarantee that every person in this country  young or old  can get access to the quality care they need and deserve. Im proud to co-sponsor #M4A!

The House just passed a resolution to block the #FakeTrumpEmergency and co-sponsoring it was an easy decision. Trumps attempt to take money away from our military to build a costly, ineffective border wall is illegal and a grotesque abuse of power.

It's always a pleasure to meet with Nevadans who have served our nation with dignity and pride. Thanks for stopping by @DAVHQ and @AmericanLegion! https://t.co/Gm68coirC5

I enjoyed meeting with our local letter carriers today. These folks keep on delivering for Nevada! https://t.co/8iPDj4Rved

More than 50 years after passage of the Voting Rights Act, states and localities across the nation are making it harder for voters of color to participate in our democracy. We must come together and finally #RestoreTheVOTE https://t.co/XQPhXHn0Ba

In Nevada we treasure our #PublicLands and we know they must be protected for future generations to enjoy. That's why I'm proud to support the biggest conservation agreement in years and support the permanent re-authorization of the #LWCF.

Today #TeamTitus attended the ribbon cutting ceremony for the expansion of @VALasVegas intensive care unit capabilities. The new Tele-ICU system will provide local medical staff with bedside access to experts who are trained in the care of critically ill patients. https://t.co/5K9zTwnI7E

I hope this campaign is more than a PR stunt. If this Administration is serious about ending the criminalization of homosexuality around the world, I look forward to their support of the GLOBE Act I introduced last Congress to oppose anti-LGBT abuses overseas. https://t.co/qm3V5ktzyW

Every Member of Congress swore an oath to defend our Constitution. The #FakeTrumpEmergency clearly violates our system of checks and balances. I hope the @HouseGOP and @SenateGOP will join us in fighting Trump's grotesque abuse of power.

Thank you for voting to protect our state and its people. #NVLeg https://t.co/f1eFvNFuEY

My heart breaks for Aurora today. Im grateful to the first responders on the scene. We simply cannot continue to respond to the epidemic of gun violence with inaction.

This is a major victory for Nevadans and for everyone who cares about the safety of our communities. Congratulations to the #NVLeg and @GovSisolak on a job well done. Now its time for Congress to pass #HR8 to expand background checks and reduce gun violence nationally. https://t.co/LgiC7VDhia

When discussing his illegal plan to build the wall, Trump just admitted, "I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster."

Does that sound like a legitimate national emergency to anyone? It certainly doesn't to me. I bet it won't to the courts either.

Declaring a national emergency to build a costly, ineffective border wall is illegal and a grotesque abuse of power. https://t.co/BVwqQI66X6

Donald Trump's claim that there is a crisis at the border is simply not true. Declaring a national emergency to build a costly, ineffective border wall is illegal and a grotesque abuse of power. (1/2)

Im sending my heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims of the cowardly terrorist attack in Indias Jammu and Kashmir state today. #KashmirTerrorAttack

The Department of Energy has lied to Nevadans and their elected representatives for decades, and I have no reason to believe that will change. In todays meeting about @NNSANews's unchecked and unethical decision to secretly ship plutonium to Nevada, I learned nothing new. (1/2)

Let us remember the 17 souls lost and the 17 injured at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last year due to senseless gun violence. Las Vegas stands with Parkland. #MSDStrong #VegasStrong https://t.co/YoqWtyYDjv

The first ever Congressional hearing on marijuana banking is taking place right now. Nevada is proof that the era of marijuana prohibition is over. It's time for the federal government to start acting like it.

I'm proud to help introduce the Keep Americans Safe Act with @RepTedDeutch. Firearms with high-capacity magazines have no place in our classrooms, concert venues, or communities. Families in Las Vegas know all too well the deadly consequences of inaction. https://t.co/6ttuZ2Rxtr

It's completely unacceptable for anyone to use anti-Semitic slurs and Im glad that Congresswoman Omar apologized. I hope that she will learn from this regrettable moment and reject bigotry and hate in all its ugly forms.

Good news. Plus hemp uses less water than alfalfa. https://t.co/w2RDhzeef8

Trumps #SOTU was long on promises and short on substance. I wish I could say that I'm surprised that he spent much of his speech demonizing immigrants, but didnt find the time to say a single word about reducing gun violence.

Ending the spread of HIV is a noble goal. So why did the President fire all the members of his HIV/AIDS advisory council? #SOTU

The commitments the President is making about infrastructure in tonight's #SOTU sound a lot like the commitments he made last year...and then forgot about.

I noticed something weird in the House chamber tonight. When Trump mentioned building the wall, Republicans didn't shout out that Mexico would pay for it.  #SOTU

"Legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways," says the President who proposed cutting legal immigration in half. #SOTU

Donald Trump is bragging about cutting regulations that protect our clean air and water. He seems to think that siding with big banks over American consumers is something to be proud of. #SOTU

From Downtown to Chinatown, Las Vegas is home to some of the most popular #ChineseNewYear celebrations in the country. I hope youll join me in celebrating the #YearOfThePig. Gung Hay Fat Choy! https://t.co/7tqHAcOS1M

The only exciting part about tonight's #SOTU will be seeing @SpeakerPelosi looking over the Presidents shoulder instead of Paul Ryan.

Congratulations. Give em hell! https://t.co/7ww0boxo4B

Today, I met with Becky and Vanessa, two TSA workers who were hurt by the #TrumpShutdown. TSA employees still have not received their full pay from their time working during the shutdown. It's wrong for Trump to threaten to do this all over again. https://t.co/zUtPQjroSF

At tomorrow night's #SOTU address, I'm leaving my guest seat open in honor of the victims of the senseless mass shooting that took place in Las Vegas over a year ago. I hope President Trump notices this empty seat and recognizes the deadly consequences of inaction. #VegasStrong

I know from experience that you cant trust the Department of @ENERGY, especially under the Trump Administration, but we must do all we can to provide transparency about the secret plutonium shipment and get at the truth in order to protect the people of Nevada.

Nevada is home to the nations largest population of wild horses and burros. These symbols of the West are a source of pride for our residents, visitors, and tribal communities. Sadly, the Trump Administration is making it harder for us to protect these beautiful animals. https://t.co/0ghhWFGZPY

This #BlackHistoryMonth and every month, let's honor the lives of those who sacrificed so much for the promise of equality and celebrate the countless contributions the African American community has made to our nation.

Theres no better way to celebrate the Chinese New Year than with a display featuring 32,000 flowers and a 12-foot-tall pig.  #OnlyInDistrict1 https://t.co/i4LXPJMxuj

It's absurd that it took this long for the House to hold hearings on gun violence prevention. We should start with legislation to expand background checks and ban bump stocks. Let's get to work. https://t.co/Be9RtqliJ7

Time and again, we've seen Trump Administration officials treat Nevada as the dumping ground for the nations nuclear waste. If @ENERGY thinks that making such a reckless decision under the shroud of secrecy will allow them to move forward with Yucca Mountain, they are mistaken. https://t.co/s9OHaxhH29

Ten years ago today, @BarackObama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. It has been a valuable tool in the fight for #EqualPay and I'm proud that it was the first bill I ever voted for in Congress. Still, we have more work to do to end wage discrimination against women.

It was a pleasure to welcome Consul General Wang Donghua of China in San Francisco to District One. We must continue to maintain and build upon the important travel and tourism relationship between Las Vegas and China.

As a member of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus, I'll continue to raise awareness of animal welfare. I'm honored to be recognized by the @HumaneSociety as a leader in Congress on these vital issues, and I'm proud to receive a 100% on their 2018 scorecard.

Today I sent a letter to the Chairman of @NRDems to urge him to protect our wild horses and burros. These symbols of the American West are a source of pride for Nevada's residents, visitors, and tribal communities.

The nonpartisan @USCBO says the shutdown will cost the American economy $11 billion. Federal workers missed two paychecks. Trump's tantrum hurt hardworking people.

#TeamTitus at the Latino Bar Association Board Induction Dinner. https://t.co/BqPxRdguCv

It took far too long for this senseless Trump tantrum to come to an end. Trump said he would be "proud" to shut down the government, but the consequences of this shutdown are nothing to be proud of.

Enough is enough, Mr. President. Your tantrum has gone on far too long. Let's #EndTheShutdown now. https://t.co/uMq2iXyy6j

The "law and order" President has certainly surrounded himself with a whole lot of people who don't seem to think twice about violating federal laws.

#TeamTitus welcomes Consul General Tomochika Uyama of #Japan in San Francisco to District One. https://t.co/hqSVS4epSJ

Whether we realize it or not, we're all impacted by the curtailing of food inspections and the inability of FBI agents to follow leads that would take criminals off our streets during this shutdown. In Nevada, over 3,500 federal workers have been forced to go without pay. https://t.co/MKpct1duBD

Im honored that my colleagues elected me to serve as Chair of the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management. Lets get to work! https://t.co/F8cvqm0ZbT

The President said he would be "proud" to shut down the government. Now federal workers are struggling, airports are strained, food inspections have been curtailed, and FBI agents say our security is threatened. 

Is Trump looking for someone to congratulate him for all of this?

I'm thrilled to re-join @HomelandDems. My top priority will be the safety and security of Las Vegas residents and visitors. At the same time, you better believe we'll be holding the Trump Administration accountable for its cruel anti-immigrant agenda. https://t.co/v1FSd2v2Hz

We're excited to have you in Las Vegas, @iamcardib. Can we get rants about Trump in between songs?? #OnlyInDistrict1 https://t.co/iowoxk26N2

I want Nevadans who are struggling during this shutdown to know that I've voted several times to re-open the government, and I won't stop fighting for them. Until the #TrumpShutdown ends, @reviewjournal put together some useful resources for those in need.
https://t.co/jTH7DnMYhu

Instead of working to #EndtheShutdown, Donald Trump is making new demands. He is preventing federal employees from getting the paychecks they have earned.

I'm thinking of @mayoroflasvegas and wish her all the best as she begins her journey to beat breast cancer. Please know that #TeamTitus is here to offer all our support.

As we honor the life and legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., let's recommit to bending the arc of history towards justice.

Had a great evening attending tonight's #MLK Scholarship Banquet. https://t.co/afYAADxu5Y

The Presidents desperate political theater did not include any indication that he would end this shutdown soon. Stoking fear about immigrants will not help federal workers finally get the paychecks they have earned. Enough is enough with this reckless Trump shutdown.

It is a pleasure to welcome Consul General Wang Donghua of #China in San Francisco to District One. Las Vegas and China have an important travel and tourism relationship. https://t.co/i1LvUYpZEx

For two years, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives refused to conduct any oversight of Donald Trump profiting from his presidency and violating the Constitution. That's about to change.

By refusing to separate himself from the Trump Organization's business interests, Donald Trump is profiting from the presidency. I joined @Maddow last night to discuss my plan to hold the President accountable for this violation of the Constitution. https://t.co/icVbcfgki6

Tonight, @GovSisolak laid out a strong progressive vision to move Nevada forward. I am grateful that we have a Governor who will fight for education, healthcare, and the environment while continuing to grow our economy. #NVSOTS

It took him some time to make good on our friendly bet, but today @MarkAmodeiNV2 sported @unlv letters and painted our mini Fremont Cannon red. I know the cannon won't change colors next year when @unlvfootball beats @NevadaFootball again. #BEaREBEL https://t.co/5RkIpwlsmt

As long as the President continues to personally profit from the Trump Hotel in Washington, he is essentially accepting bribes from giant corporations looking for sweetheart deals.

No American should work full time and still live in poverty. That's why I'm proud to help introduce the #RaiseTheWage Act. One job should be enough to take care of a family.

https://t.co/w5nvSuI012

The House has voted multiple times to #EndTheShutdown. The American people are fed up and tired of this Trump tantrum. Families are struggling and they need the @SenateGOP to hold a vote and re-open the government.

This reckless DOJ reversal will inject uncertainty into a well-regulated market and push consumers back into the black market. Unfortunately, the Trump Administration only supports states rights when it is politically convenient. https://t.co/2Y9M3yST0b

The Trump Administration has twice tried and failed to allow employers to deny workers contraceptive coverage. As a member of the @ProChoiceCaucus I welcome this news, but the fight to protect access to affordable #BirthControl continues. https://t.co/ryp0anx3VZ

Mr. President, our federal workers should not be pawns in your twisted political games. They are real families needlessly suffering because of the #TrumpShutdown. Stop holding their paychecks hostage for your vanity project.

I'm excited to announce that Vinny Spotleson is joining #TeamTitus as our District Director. He brings years of valuable experience to our Las Vegas office and I know his leadership and political acumen will serve our constituents well.

Trump said he would be proud to shut down the government over a border wall that he promised Mexico would pay for - and in the process hes preventing thousands of Nevadans from receiving their paychecks. The American people have had enough of this latest Trump tantrum.

The Trump Admin. continues to go after Nevada's #WildHorse herds; dismissing science and wasting taxpayer dollars on costly roundups and holdings. Read more about my efforts to protect these denizens of the West in this article from @garymartindc. https://t.co/O9HO8tLpXF

On #VeteransDay we pause to honor the brave Airmen, Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who have served our country in the armed forces. Their sacrifice and commitment to American ideals have helped shape our democracy and remind us of what unites us.

Our veterans of all war eras, men and women, LGBT, and of diverse backgrounds, deserve our deepest gratitude.

We can never fully repay them for their service and sacrifice; but we can do more to help our veterans in their transition to civilian life through access to quality education, careers, and more effective post-service care.

I hope you will join me in taking a moment this Veterans Day to reflect on the family member, friend, or stranger who answered the call to service. They deserve our thanks every day.

During my time in Congress, I have worked to give our veterans and their families those opportunities, and I will continue to fight to ensure they receive the resources, benefits, and care they deserve.

The Trump Admin. is proposing redefining high-level nuclear waste. Make no mistake, this will open up Nevada to be destination #1 for this dangerous waste. https://t.co/Hoe0SEVlH9

International travel to the United States is critical to Nevada and the United States' economy. #BrandUSA does not cost taxpayers a single dime, and is the only program dedicated to promoting travel to the United States, overseas.

Las Vegas is a destination for more than 40 million visitors from all around the world. @VisitTheUSA, our nation's public-private partnership promoting international travel to the U.S., recently featured Las Vegas in its #AskALocal series. Check it out: https://t.co/gtaV2vk61F

This evening we remember the victims and their loved ones at the @CityOfLasVegas #RemembranceGarden https://t.co/Up8Li4nTYf

President is claiming that he "knocking out bump stocks." He is either lying or naive. You can buy them today. Meaningful action requires a change of law. The ATF has been clear about that.

One year later, we remember the 58 killed and the many still suffering from that harrowing night. In this morning's @LasVegasSun, I joined #1October survivor Christine Caria to pen an OpEd calling for leadership to address gun violence. #VegasStronger https://t.co/JSyn6hWUoL

We begin this day of remembrance @ClarkCountyNV where there is no doubt that we are #VegasStronger. https://t.co/uE18Il4TGA

I joined #1October survivor Christine Caria to author this piece in the @LasVegasSun. In the last year weve seen little progress to address gun violence, but more leadership is needed. You have the power to make that happen. #VegasStrong https://t.co/NyB9NBqtZR

I stated my opposition to Judge #Kavanaughs nomination prior to these serious allegations based on his judicial philosophy and rulings. The Judiciary Comm. should have postponed the vote on his nomination till the bipartisan-requested FBI investigation was completed.

This week, I was at @ValdostaState University to talk about how women are changing politics by turning out to vote and running for office to break barriers. #HERstory

Sept. 27th is the day that Native womens pay catches up with their white male counterparts pay from the previous year. Sadly this makes sense when Native women are paid just $.61 on the dollar in NV. Women deserve #equalpay!

In the final days before the House heads home before the midterms, the Republicans are pushing propaganda resolutions that ignore real threats to our democratic institutions to please the readers of Breitbart "News". Total waste of time.

The House just passed the bipartisan #FAA bill, which includes a number of provisions I championed that benefit travelers and Nevada's economy. Now it is off to the Senate for consideration. https://t.co/pkCbBgn4Hi

Today I joined my Democratic colleagues in support of Dr. Ford and all survivors of sexual assault and harassment. We must #BelieveSurvivors. https://t.co/yhdSxeWdHh

As a strong advocate for the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), I believe that survivors of sexual assault deserve more from their Congress than a short term extension. Lets renew #VAWA and the vital programs it supports.

Even before these allegations came to light I opposed Judge Kavanaugh's appointment to the SCOTUS. His judgement and clear bias in his court decisions are disqualifying enough. Moving forward with this nominee at this point is unacceptable. #BelieveWomen

The allegations against #Kavanaugh should not be taken lightly. That is why Im asking the Senate to delay his nomination until there is a full investigation of what happened. See the letter I sent with my fellow @HouseDemWomen and dozens of my House colleagues. https://t.co/9Cs97Hcaht

The #FMLA took effect 25 years ago, giving workers job-protected leave to care for themselves &amp; their families. To build on that progress I support passage of the #HealthyFamiliesAct, because taking a sick day shouldnt mean going without pay

Following my bipartisan request the VA has enacted the 1st federal policy encouraging the adoption of dogs, cats, &amp; other lab animals. Proud to be part of this victory esp. since Nevada was one of the 1st states to pass a lab animal adoption law. https://t.co/sibg7igss0

The Trump Admin. is about to allow blueprints for print-at-home, untraceable #3Dguns to be released on the internet. Today I wrote AG Laxalt asking him to intervene on behalf of the State of Nevada. This is a major safety threat. https://t.co/nvwoiv5LUq

I have long believed that women should not pay more in taxes, health care, or anything else just for being women. #PinkTax (1/2)

Great to meet with members of Ukraines Parliament with @OWprogram to discuss the role of women in the legislature, Russias aggression, and the strong U.S.-Ukraine relationship. https://t.co/BGVyxoMiL5

The main concern of child welfare services should be the best interest of the child. It is NOT in the best interest of the child to deny them a loving, qualified home b/c of a parents religion, race, sexual orientation, or gender identity. #LicenseToDiscriminate

Honored to join with @NCILAdvocacy and disability rights activists to fight to protect the #ADA and advocate for accessibility for all. As a member of the @HFACDemocrats I am championing the rights of persons with disabilities all around the world. #NCIL2018 https://t.co/R6jmDfu410

Health care protections and the rights of women are on the line with Brett Kavanaughs nomination to #SCOTUS. I oppose his nomination and will #CommitToRoe to protect access to safe, legal abortion if he is confirmed.

Nearly a year after #HurricaneMaria hit Puerto Rico thousands remain without power on the island. Given the fragile state of the rebuilding, and the threats expected this hurricane season, now is NOT the time to remove the emergency power generators.

Not many are aware of the important role Admin. Law Judges play in the federal government. This dangerous move by the Trump Administration applies a 'loyalty oath' favoring the political agenda of the President. https://t.co/tnX0d1cxGa

Judge Kavanaughs nomination is a clear threat to womens reproductive rights. I stand with my colleagues to say #StopKavanaugh. #WhatsAtStake

The Trump Admin. will miss todays deadline to reunite kids under 5. Yesterday the Admin. lost its bid to detain families together indefinitely. The Trump zero-tolerance policy was poorly thought-out and continues to hurt children. #KeepFamiliesTogether

Today #NRC Commissioner Wright, who has long-advocated for #YuccaMountain, refused to recuse himself from the licensing process. Guess we shouldn't be surprised since so many in this Admin. have conflicts of interest. See my full statement: https://t.co/WryhMUhKDz

On this day in 1964, President Johnson signed the #CivilRightsAct into law. This landmark legislation prevents discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin.

One year ago today the first recreational marijuana sales began in the State of Nevada. The growth of the industry has created thousands of new jobs and generated over $70 million in new tax revenue for the state. I'll continue to advocate to protect the state's interests in DC.

Today's #SCOTUS ruling on #Janus is a direct attack on collective bargaining, better wages, safer working conditions, secure retirement, and affordable health care for our public employees plain and simple. Read my full statement below: https://t.co/uZ88e53Mt4

#NursesWeek2018 is the perfect time to recognize the hard work of nurses, especially in our schools. My bill, the NURSE Act, will help schools hire more full-time nurses, because healthier students are better prepared to learn. https://t.co/A9CYFbfNNO

With a pro-Yucca Mountain bill coming to the floor this week, I filed an amendment that would strike the language and instead establish a consent based siting process. Nevada does not want nuclear waste, but other states do. They can have it. https://t.co/0eKERDdFt4

Next week, Rep. Shimkus will bring his Screw Nevada 2.0 Bill to the floor. This legislation to rubber-stamp the licensing of Yucca Mountain to turn Nevada into the nation's nuke waste dump is bad policy, and I'll continue to fight it every step of the way. #NotAWasteland

The latest lawsuit from the @TXAG to end #DACA is appalling. This morning, I sent a letter to AG @AdamLaxalt requesting that Nevada stay away from this lawsuit and remember the contributions of DACA recipients in Nevada. https://t.co/cIc9PWnkNL

#TrumpBudget foolishly calls to dump the nations #NuclearWaste in #Nevada. We need a president who understands that a consent-based solution is the only solution. #NotAWasteland.

Budgets are a reflection of our priorities. The #TrumpBudget highlights an administration that's more concerned with obstructing the safety net, alienating our allies, and paying for the costly tax scam than investing in working families.

This morning Democrats will once again try to force a vote on the #DreamAct. This will be the 21st time we have asked Republicans to take action on the floor to protect DREAMers since Trump ended DACA. Again they will ignore our calls for action.

Since the last government shutdown, Republican leadership has made no effort to hold hearings, offer debate, or tackle the tough issues. The CR is fiscally unsound, stunningly hypocritical, and morally bankrupt.
