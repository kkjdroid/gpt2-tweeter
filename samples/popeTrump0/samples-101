I am monitoring the situation in Puerto Rico very closely. There is no need to delay the vote - the only thing that can happen is the Republicans staying and continuing the assault. https://t.co/0o7i1J5Jhx

Congressman Fred Upton has been tracking the flooding in Puerto Rico for a long time. I heard from him quickly, and he informed me that his team was with him and that they were with the people of Poway. Others also knew Fred very well.

Fred is the kind of man who is tough and polite - he will only hurt you if he sees something bad. If you hurt him, he will go fishing. You will be fine!

I was briefed yesterday by FBI about the flooding in Puerto Rico.  As we all know, the Dems will try to get the vote for Military Construction Passes delayed indefinitely. Make your minds up as to whether or not the vote should go forward, because we want this completed. We want to win!

The Democrats in Congress cannot let our Country fall into the hands of foreign powers without first removing all Democrats from power. They have allowed our Country to be invaded by the Trump Radical Leftists in one of the most brutal and vicious crimes in the history of the United States!

If we give the Republicans the votes to delay the votes, they will take our Constitutional right to keep and bear arms - &amp; we will all die In the process.

THANK YOU NEWSWEEK, GREAT NEWS! https://t.co/mHqbQ1a0w4

Puerto Rico is the number one priority State for ALL Americans. We are with you all the way. America is great without you. America will never forget! https://t.co/tL1RpAUTH9f

So after having lunch with President Rumsfeld and First Lady, and continuing to monitor the situation there very closely, we agreed to give the Republicans no time to use Force to Displace Democrats - and we agreed to give them 1 - 2 Weeks to do so. Now that they have won, they will let the American people make their final decision.

.@seanhannity said Puerto Rico should stay the hell out on the 3rd of July! So true!

Why was @FLOTUS Melania and I allowed to take our beautiful flags for all to see in Miami? They didnt even do a Fade Before Night....

Congratulations to The Bahamas! This is perhaps the greatest honor a foreign leader can ask a foreign leader. Congratulations to @DowJobs!

.@FoxNews Polls are at their lowest point in 50 years, 51-49%, and all hope is not not a little doubt that President Trump will win. Will he? Absolutely not. Will the Media Fake it? Probably not!

We are the ENVY of choice America over Russia. We are stronger and more powerful than ever before. We have a beautiful and wonderful people!

In honor of his 71 year record of Americas Advancing Science &amp; Industry, Admiral Mike Gordon will serve as First Deputy Commandant of the United States Coast Guard. @foxandfriends  @LouDobbs  He will be greatly missed.

No Collusion, No Obstruction. Democrats must get this mess straightened out.

.@foxandfriends Polls at their highest point in years (71 yr). Democrats &amp; Republicans must get this mess straightened out and give Bongino a try. Im pleased to report that Democrat Nancy Pelosi is finally letting up. She wants to see this mess resolved
