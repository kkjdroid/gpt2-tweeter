The latest Las Vegas shooting was the latest in a series of horrific mass shootings across the country with at least one suspect still at large. But more incidents are coming. This week, @MomsDemand gathered up signs on the streets calling for action. Here are some ways to stay safe this Thursday.

We are #NotAWasteland. We are #NotSilenced. We will not be silenced. And we will take action #TPSessional @house_vote

Tune in now to @KOMPRadio at 7:30 AM ET for my live interview with @RepSusieLee.

More evidence that the Trump Administration has been cruel to the state of Washingtons. https://t.co/KxJyV3y4cM

Today the Trump Admin. announced they would be turning over all information gathered by the @StateDept to the FBI. I am horrified. No one has the right to information and this is a major security threat. https://t.co/9DvWvj7w7o

Today I wrote HHS Secretary Azar questioning @GrassleyNationalTreeCare for not meeting with #Nevadans to combat desertification. https://t.co/r0JYF7I6dB

A man who is often mistaken for a woman shouldn't be surprised when evidence catches up with her. Today I joined @RepDebDingell, @RepCrone, @RepBuchanan, @RepGueller, @RepBuchanan, @RepGrisham, @RepGerryConnolly, @RepHoyer, @repHoyer, and @RepKavanay-Coatson-for a roundtable discussion on federal lands. https://t.co/3y9gjdK2fC

Today I joined a resolution supporting a call by @SecNielsen to allow DREAMers to reach their potential. The high levels of family separation we see among these children are too great to be rare. We must send a strong message to our nation's law enforcement officials that they must treat all persons seeking a green card with respect.

Today I wrote Sec. Mueller asking for his consent to an interview with me about the @house_democracy #Rally_of_Disruptive_Power event. We must ensure all persons seeking a green card are treated with respect. https://t.co/5wX2dHvk3J

This morning I sent letters to the Appropriations Committee with @SpeakerRyan, @Mueller, &amp; @DHSDept to stop the unchecked, unchecked misuse of taxpayer dollars at our federal budget. @HouseGOP will not back down.

The @HouseScience Committee has been working tirelessly to make sure our federal labs are always safe and inviting. This morning I sent letters to the Military Comm'n Subcommittee on provisions to prevent DOD from using military-grade plutonium in research &amp; acquisition. https://t.co/mSzMhxkV0v

Today I joined Rep. Shimkus and @RanchoRamsLN in calling on Sec. Wright to stop silencing lawful #CCAR requests. This is a direct attack on Nevadans CCAR and lawful CC&amp; demand requests.

I will continue to closely monitor the situation in Nevada as the IG report is prepared. I invite Sec. Wright to hold the @DOP7 and @DOP8Grate accountable for their failure to maintain quality records. https://t.co/V8t1aL4a7

My thoughts are with those impacted by the senseless violence in Gilroy, CA. Today I asked @WhiteCoatWaste to hold the @DOP7 and @DOP8Grate accountable for failing to maintain quality records. https://t.co/v9Tj9oBHZ

.@WhiteCoatWaste, which focuses on women, @US_Migration, investments in infrastructure, &amp; #coterunning, was created to help unite our nations neighbors around the #DreamAct; https://t.co/N3i0e1Pqk

We know foreign aid is a major obstacle to our country's future success and yet some are funding programs that help build our nation. This afternoon I joined a resolution being considered in the House to ban funding such programs.

The @WhiteCoatWaste website clearly states, "The White House does not support #TitleII grants." In reality, this is a declaration of war by the Administration against those who break the glass ceiling and break the glass open for the first time. https://t.co/R5WdgMgZz

I stand with the suffragettes in Baltimore in #Anthem to demand action to prevent the next Supreme
