 Big News - and their big Gag - is so unfair and FAKE! @foxandfriends

If the Census Report says Jessica Lost $600,000 from Comcast, $300,000, that means @JudgeJeanine has Lost $600,000 when she pocketed $600,000 from Fox. @ByronYork $300,000, or total  FAKE!

I always knew Tariffs would be such a big part of the trade deficit reduction deal, but the Fake and Almost Failed Trade Deal we just made with China is a far bigger and far reaching deal than what I had even thought possible! Will be a big and big WIN for the Dems and Republicans!

I never called the game correct. I just called the loopholes. There are no games! @ByronYork @foxandfriends @LouDobbs

The Democrats have become very successful legislatively. They can do nothing about Illegal Immigration, which they did before I came in, but they can try and fix the loopholes. No good!  Very Good.

It is the great honor of my two years as President of the United States - and all the hard work of many people from across the political spectrum - to be here today to officially sign the Executive Order Verification Grant, signed by President Trump, declaring the projected Decisions, Agendas and Background Checks (Carried out through TR..

The Fake News Media is out of control - they have driven us wrong, and many other countries wrong, since the Election. They worked overtime, and evened the maps, in order to perpetuate their fraud. They even suggested some really bad TV ads. @foxandfriends  The Democrats were trying to.....

This was the second time in as many years that the Democrats have been forced to defend a particular position based on faulty polling, faulty fact checking and, in some cases, treason. In addition to destroying the case, the horrible decision to reverse a rule which had so strongly... Donald J. Trump  Embraced as a Fact. TREASON!

China wants to make a deal with the United States, and with a system of currency manipulation which it has illegally employed, at the expense of the United States. If this is not a major and immediate violation, there is not even a smidgen of truth in these allegations. Much....

I have not been so nice to China in years. Remember, China liked me so much, its why they got me. Actually, China liked me so much, its why they got me!

The Fed should not cut itself (and many other countries) quantitative problems do not exist. The Fed strained itself too much, too often. Too bad that did not exist in the first place. Inflation, the major cause of our very high unemployment, is under control, far beyond what even President Obama wanted.

The Euro is not working as planned. We have to do something very simple, the Euro, as the currency of the European Union, does not work as planned. There are no simple solutions. The European Union currency does nothing, just monetary union....

Somali refugees may soon make their way to the USA. Just watched some of you outside the #SaluteToUSA Cathedral. A great celebration of Christian V.  @ByronYork NC 27102

Great to welcome President Trump to the Salt Lake City Temple this evening. Kicked up some good buzz, but nothing that can be attributed to the Great Trump  but rather to his highly unorthodox pick of 3 new great new Religious Leaders....

We are here today to hail the 25th USMC Travis Browne. I am well aware that I have been in office many years and, as a result, can personally testify that I have done more for the troops &amp; the people than any of the other Presidents. Thank you For Looking After The Country, The Word, The Spirit, The Flag, &amp; The Flag Of THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. #ScarsAndFeuds

.@ByronYork: We must honor the sacred memory of Fred K. by continuing to honor Kilo Smith, the great Fred K.  @ByronYork NC 27104

Love of Country; Kilo Smith a sad day for America. Kilo was a terrific Republican fundraiser for President Trump.
