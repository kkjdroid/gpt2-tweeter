 who we are.
Thank you, America! @CNN @OANN Thank you!
A great and very talented man by the name of @DanPompeo ! https://t.co/KlB8b8G8Tk
Just heard that Dan Powell will soon be leaving Fox Broadcasting, where he is a must-watch, and heading outside of the Big Three.....
When you have a Conservative Media that is despised by all, and that is starting to embrace the Liberal Democrat Party, what are they getting themselves into, right, with the Liberal Democrat Party?
The Conservative Media is becoming the Enemy of the PEOPLE, as the Democrats are refusing to cooperate with the Republican Party. A disgrace.  #MAGA
There is no better way to show your support for President Obamas long as you are from the GREAT STATE of ORANGEH, OR YOUTH!
If there was ever a time to be patriotic, it was the day that Mexico agreed to Open Fire On The U.S. https://t.co/lW8E0BJP2s
The great journalist and political analyst Dan Chizik, who is a friend of mine as does my great opponent, Gary Johnson! https://t.co/JXb4BJMjEo
No matter what the Republicans do, they will never be able to get Chuck Schumer to change his mind. That means a vote of NO, NOT! So, now the Republicans!
This was the beginning of the end for @FoxNews, and now Dan Chizik is quitting the @FoxNews  @TeamSchumer  It should have been President Trump, not me, who was in the audience, and having a good time (by no stretch of the imagination...
Thank you @Maggie_Warner, you are truly the future of television!
Just got back from China to announce the formation of the China Aerospace & Telecom Industry (CATT) Group. Our company will have a great deal to do at China's leading auto show during my visit.  @FoxNews   I look forward to speaking with the COO, James McCarthy, during my visit. We are a great trade partner, one of the best in the world, and one that is looking even better for China. I look forward to talking to you all soon!
Big deal, so far. China is buying American Mercedes .....
Greatest economic numbers in almost 50 years. Wall is being raised very fast. They want Wall..
A good week for China starts today. Remember how President Xi congratulated us on our great trade accomplishments and said that he was very happy to see us  he is far more in tune with the FUTURE of our economy. He has time to visit!
Big news today: the Federal Reserve is correct that China is buying American products, and much more. A quick look at the record setting 3.0% GDP, and the best growth in nearly 50 years! The Fed   cannot be blamed for wanting to cut interest rates, and its the way they were asked to do by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The Fed should act on the letter....
The Great Dan Chizik just spoke! We are not at the Fed level, and are too short on money. If we stopped short, the Fed would fix the problems they have!
We are working very hard and with great enthusiasm with China and the U.K. We look good at the Wall. They dont recognize....
Thank you to @Steve_Korland, CEO of General Electric..
Great to be here today!
Big announcement today: Chinese companies have a say in the prices that they charge the U.S. for steel. We will likewise increase our steel prices to match. It will put an end to companies wanting to use steel from overseas!
A big help for Democrats! https://t.co/0xZjbxUzUQ
I was very disappointed with the decision to cut rates with China, and very disappointed with the way they voted. If China wanted to fix the problem  I would have done so (with great difficulty in my negotiation) with them &amp; many other countries. I want to get there before 2019, not 2019......
A very smart &amp; interesting guy, he is a great leader &amp; an outstanding businessman. The Democrats have gone totally bonkers over him! #TrumpScandal https://t.co/WL4Fua9zJ2
