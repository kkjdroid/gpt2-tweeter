Despite the very weak economy, our leaders are only making more promises....

RT @WhiteHouse: "There is no emergency in the form of a raise today; there has not been a crisis thus far." https://t.co/5E2lMtW4xH

The Republican Party has failed the American people and the American people are angry. This is not some premeditated mob operation. This is an honest working Republican Party with a long and distinguished history of standing up to the Democrats. Its time to stand up to what your party stands for . Very important.....

Today, despite the very weak economy, our leaders are only making more promises that will have a huge impact on our Country. But they have done nothing for our Country!

Congressional Democrats on Trade today worked very hard on the Tariffs to our Eurozone friends and are doing nothing. In fact, many of the Tariffs are being paid for at a very low rate! The ridiculousness is ridiculous!

Congressional Democrats have worked very hard on the Tariffs and are doing nothing!

When President Xi of China announced this week that he was developing an agreement with the United States to pay for 75 Billion Dollars in defense and medical supplies for our adversaries, including China, and Mexico, our Wall was greatly extended?

Despite what your political leaders say, the Dems &amp; the Radical Left Republicans in Congress want to continue blocking &amp; passing our very important Border Crisis through the confirmation of a new Border Justice Officer....

....this month...and will only end if Hillary Clinton wins the Election. If she does, we will finally have an emergency border crisis. We are already dealing with 10 Billion Dollars in Tariffs and payments for drugs, guns &amp; human trafficking. You dont have to be President for us to end it....

....the U.S.-Mexico Border, much of it being paid for using Tax Dollars already made, in large part by Mexico, the EU, and other countries with strong demands for our Southern Border, will then be paid for, together, by a small small Government that is taking in much needed relief from their recession. They dont own you!

Mexico has just imposed a Tariff of 13 Billion Dollars ($2.1 Billion) on Mexico for refusing to issue visas for illegals to visit with family and friends. Mexico must immediately stop issuing visas for illegals....

The Democrats are doing nothing to stop illegal immigration &amp; the Democrats in Congress must work very hard to fix our broken immigration laws. They have done nothing for American Border Security &amp; Accountability!

China and other countries, all of them fleeing poverty, are refusing to help us with our very sacred Southern Border - because there is no money left for it!

....Our great Stock Market for many years, until the Great Recession, and now the Recession, has left us in a very dangerous situation. While many countries are looking for ways to use our very inexpensive currency, it will soon expire, leaving us in very negative territory. This is why the Fed must be very careful....

On our Southern Border, which is now being extended and will soon be fully extended, and with much faster passage than the Fed allowed, we will have GREAT Trade, Employment and Agriculture, for a great Economy!

The U.S. Economy grew by more than 10% in November, almost all coming into the U.S. from Mexico and China! It was good for Mexico, good for the USA!

....for our very sacred Southern Border - because there is no money left for it!

The Democrats are dealing with a crisis in which they have to deal with many illegal immigrants just to get that illegal immigration to stop. They are allowing thousands of illegal aliens into our country, but very few...

The Democrats in Congress can continue blocking &amp; passing a dangerous Homeland Security and Emergency Act that will make Mexico, very wealthy and powerful, very afraid of our nation on our Southern Border. Our Country will be safe and sound again, without Mexico, and without the Radical Left Democrats.....

Thank you Mrs. Clinton, a very special people!
