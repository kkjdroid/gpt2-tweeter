 them that were trying to shut down the free press. They were hoping for a major defeat, but that failed, and are hoping a big victory has NOTHING to do with Mueller!

My friend, Senator Ron DeSantis from Florida, is a brilliant and brilliant businessman and organizer. I thank Ron for representing me well in the U.S. Senate, and for staying true to the promise of America!

The Democrats have won more Senate seats than any president in modern memory, and that's good for the middle class. I fully understand the anger of the working class, but the reason they won Congress was because they wanted to keep the Republicans out of the White House. If we were going to be President, who the hell would win another election, this one in 2020?

The Tax Cuts will make your business stronger, and your workers less expensive, while protecting the wealthy 2%. https://t.co/F9oHrGtjW

Great news for people in the military. Military spouses are now offered more coverage than ever before. Now they have access to doctors. They can do all of the tests for a doctor now, and get it straightened out for them! https://t.co/YsRjxj2sP

The Democrats are going to do nothing before and after the Election except have a debate. They want to have a debate, not about our Countrys future and our futures, but about trying to Impeach the President. This isnt what weashers post. Theyre trying to impeach a President who doesnt do anything.

The Democrats are doing very well. The Economy is GREAT and doing great. The only problem is that the Supreme Court has never respected a Presidential Election Vote in the history of the United States, so theyre now fighting it on Constitutional grounds.

I have been calling the Democrats at the White House and their lawyers for two years, and I can tell you this, theyre going wild. Just as I said before, they need money! https://t.co/RnEz2aPq5

Thank you @TuckerCarlson! https://t.co/s9eVQJhM4J

The United States Supreme Court and Congress, in so-called bipartisan fashion, will not approve this very costly and dangerous decision. So far, the Obama Administration has not had a chance to properly review this Court case or any other. The court has the final say on this decision, but not on a Tax Cuts Bill!

Tucker Carlson Tonight on @FoxNews is #1 on CNN  and is the number one story in the United Kingdom, with 9 million viewers on @FoxNews! https://t.co/qHuezC3Fh

I am disappointed that the New York Times (and others) has not given the Pulitzer Prize to @RobertStitt. He wrote a great and highly productive book (for Free Press) on the American Revolution that has just now been printed. The book is brilliant, and is the sort of thing the American people never even thought existed!!

Why is @CNN not being called on to apologize to @MariaBartiromo? The Times did an excellent job, not only putting out a great book, but getting this guy a Pulitzer, and getting him to go to Russia to answer your questions....

Thank you to @TuckerCarlson! https://t.co/Od5o8IqQY

Great reporting and great thoughts on the fate of the Great State of New Hampshire. It remains an open question how badly these great men and women will act....
