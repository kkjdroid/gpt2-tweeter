, the U.S. has gone to war against Iraq and many other countries, including Iran. If the Democrats win the election, Iran will be forced to recognize the U.S. is not for sale. They are a racist regime that is willing to bomb cities in search of pennants to pay their ransoms!

The Democrats are a disgrace to themselves and their party for supporting a bad man in Rep. Omar (D-CA). He supports our Agenda and does a fantastic job! If this were a Democrat election, they would win easily, but instead, this year they lost by nearly 7,000 votes. Thats a much larger number than you would see in a good election.....

Democrats dont want the good will &amp; people to work, and yet their majority is so thinly spread, and only growing. Their vote is then presumably used by the Republican Party. Makes your opponent look good, while actually.....

Despite the Democrats wanting small business businesses to help with the new Tariffs, which will be taken away by the Federal Reserve next month, they only want manufacturers that are making large changes to the product to help them make a profit. No help from Fed - if anyone works at it - become a consumer!

The incompetent Mayor of San Francisco, Eric Garcetti, has been a desperately poor and very successful official at the City of San Francisco - but he is a very good mayorine! The incompetent Mayor of San Francisco, James Ward, has done a very poor job of bringing the people together. Many of us wonder if his ouster will bring new hope for me or, worse, just....

A massive crowd that I believe is working overtime in search of a Paul Ryan audience, and who love our Country,  it was warm and sunny in New Hampshire and, even, we hope, coming home to Iowa. People are great, especially in the Great South! As for Paul Ryan, he is a give or take, person - I just like people who can do something!

Jesse &amp; the Rage Squad have always loved making people feel good! They are now strong, but far reaching, and they are only getting stronger!

Puerto Rico right now is the center of the greatest possible storm in the history of our Country - the Maria......

Thank you to two brilliant Pennsylvania State Senator - and Trump Hater - @SenatorRickScott! https://t.co/h1a7TIMxA0

When our Country was stronger, courageous and totally different, the bad things that were said and done on the campaign trail disappeared, while the bad things done through policies like Tax Cuts and/or the fast pace of the economy have now been said and done. That makes the things that were said and done on the.....

Thank you Great! #GOPDebate #GOPDebate1 https://t.co/TfeVo0FZUQ

So interesting to see Progressive Democrats like @Peter_Trump and @JackHeretors throughout the #GOPDebate field. They seem to want to debate the FACTS, or lack thereof, when it comes to the candidates. Theirs even acceptable fact-checking!

Thank you @TedCruz, it's great to see everything from your spirited debate in the #GOPDebate field to your usual forgetful flip flopper on debate moderator @JohnKerry! #GOPDebate1 https://t.co/XB2iQk8e9f

What is your take on @GOPLeader? Republicans destroy free enterprise while Democrats stick up for the millionaires who own the companies....

Congratulations to @JayInslee1 on her big surprise No Collusion win. Our country was created this way, and we are doomed from the start. With Fake Polls, even though I was WRONG, I had the VICTORY to win. Thank you!

Thank you guys again to be here in North Carolina this weekend. Its one of those things that you do, do whatever you want, but as you make good progress you keep bringing bad legislation with you, and with you, along with the DIFFERENT legislation that some of us tried to.....

I am in North Carolina for one of my two consecutive elections for attorney general. It will be a busy and exciting year for our great state, for who we are and for us as a nation, and for #NeverTrumpERS!

North Carolina should immediately change the ridiculous &amp; unnecessarily lengthy #FireByron2015 registration deadline. We are in a very hot and dry month, and despite being informed that we are in a battle, are going to win it all. The registration deadline always comes down to a question of hours, and onions, and it depends on what you do on the registration wall. Hopefully this will be fixed in a very short period of time!

This is the craziest thing going in the @IndyCar &
