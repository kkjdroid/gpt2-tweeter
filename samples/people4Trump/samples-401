It's not just the Border that is Under Attack.

The Agenda of our Willless Revolution is unlimited Prosperity.

The Mainstream Media has been duped.

A Corrupt News Media called itself the News of the World, and was given NO INVESTIGATIVE CREDIBILITY. Now the Corrupt Media admits they were wrong. Now they say What?

We are a People's Democracy Party, and that means We are going to create a Green Economy, start a Green Economy immediately, and take on the damn Military Industrial complex. Economy growing rapidly, States and Local Control Groups getting the green light. Approval numbers way up. The 18 Angry Bernie Supporters have just gone huge! https://t.co/kQbYfhnR7

The Mainstream Media was completely silent on the incredible victories we are making at The White House with...https://t.co/WL9cPendingR

Crazy Lawrence ODonnell, who has been calling me wrong from even before I announced my run for President, even being on record as Angry Bernie supporters began dropping..... https://t.co/nYh4sYp3j

Courts &amp; Dems are making America more insecure by forcing GPS data caps on all cars. Great for our Genetically Modified Humans!

Before Judges Riley and Borkise, so heavily enforced, become even more strained, we must also take into account the tremendous strides we are making on the Border with Mexico...and the tremendous strides we are making on the Korean Peninsula.

When we make it to the Southern Border, our commitment to people, the bedrock principle behind our very strong relationship, stops just short of total collapse. Instead of sending 500, or 1,000, Border Patrol and Administration officials, angry democrats,...

For the record, the judge on the case (Dr. Gregory M. Craig Warrior) said it wasnt even relevant whether Comey was under investigation. The question is WHAT?

Just spoke to @AlanDersh, VP of Human Resources. Will be continuing the dialogue and continuing to listen to all of our sidekicks. People understand what we are trying to accomplish, and what the Democrat Congress stands to gain by....

We are doing very well with our Canadian and European partners against the Islamic State in Iraq and Levant. PUAH [Terrorist group] is losing huge numbers of members around the Province of Iraq and now is not the time to be allowing our allies to take advantage of us. ISIS is eating our TRUTH tonight!

With the hurricanes in Florida and Florida is Shane (Guadalupe) Alcorn's back yard. Florida where so desperately needed was robbed last yr when we made it to the White House. Defeats is what has been happening from the get go!

Hurricane Linda has already done more damage than any Category 5 (Harley) or hurricanes in any period of our lives. Our strength has always been in ouritude deterrent, which has always worked. We may soon be able to take back Texas and perhaps further, maybe even Europe!

3 straight years of losing, with China and India adding more and more ground to our already massive footprint. We have to win the North American Games, both commercially and strategically. The odds arent against us. The only question is who wins!

I met Jason Williams, the adopted daughter of a failed 2016 presidential run by Mr. Trump. In front of the cameras Mr. Trump is represented by a T-shirt that reads WATCHED GREAT &amp; admires me &amp; says he has a Win (for the season). I said I would watch the kids, maybe do a TV interview, maybe meet them in person at the White House!...

I met Mark Murphy, the father of a little boy who is very badly damaged from a hip replacement. Mark is hitting school, work and, above all, play. He is going to college, but the cost of tuition will be a big part of his future!

I met Governor @ErinBurnett this morning at the @WhiteHouse. Big first meeting of our Washington Legislative team today, with much to talk about. Lots of Democrats, including me, around than here in Pennsylvania. Look for a strong - - - - - - - - - to emerge!

#Trump2020 will be a powerful *coming soon* for Washington!
