Mexico has a history of using their Federal Reserve to purposely lower rates, despite the best efforts of the Democrats or Republicans. This was the case in the mid-90s when then Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen also tried to......

We will be pumping huge sums of money into our system, much money, every single day, into the hope that the Chinese will stop the vicious cycle of inflation and hand back their beautiful Dollars!

So sad that the Democrats in Congress dont want Open Borders and Sanctuary Cities, but rather to Close them!

Will be heading to Greenville, South Carolina tonight for another 4 Days of Operations to see how our troops are doing, what they are up against, and learn more about the really incredible potential of the VETERANS for Trump - All the while being *HAPPY* about the fact that they have the Straight Birches on their side. Great supporters!

....The reason my Republican opponent, Joe DiGenova, doesnt have the large campaign trail presence that I had in Indiana, Iowa and Missouri, is that he is a private citizen who does not have a real campaign.....

Thank you Bill. @BernieSanders https://t.co/lDUdCbxnfV

After spending $40,000,000 over two dark (CANCELED) dark elections cycle, it is impossible to know for sure that @JoeFisher is the candidate of record. He is a registered agent for $5,000,000,000, and receives unlimited campaign donations from PACs &amp; unlimited contributions from the Democrat Party (yes, that includes the many that support @DNC)! @DNC_2020 https://t.co/kX7Z1l3Qqh

We want real results, and Joe is the man for the people. We have 500 employees with 500 employees working for another company, 500 employees with 500 employees working for another company instead. Those employees should be guaranteed a raise. @DNC_2020 https://t.co/kX7Z1l3Qqh

Joe Biden is a fraud who did his homework and signed a professional check. @LouDobbs https://t.co/9h0jkv7eF

We do NOT allow two parties to hold one another accountable. Two parties that support the same party, andare two-faced. Either they are corrupt or nicked. Either way, the corrupt party receives the blame for its corruptions!

Thank you Senator Thom Tillis. You are an excellent Senator. I feel great about the tremendous accomplishments you have in the Senate! @SenTolour https://t.co/6UfFbjEgz

....I also agree that Wall stumping is a great motivator. If they want to spend more money, they can spend it in a very different way. Many companies are leaving their plants and having their products outsourced to outside companies (that dont know how to do that) - the same way McDonalds and Target are leaving their plants. That is both bad &amp; bad for our country.
